One incredibly important aspect of human and animal vision is the ability to follow objects and people in our view. Whether it is a tiger chasing its prey, or you trying to catch a basket- ball, tracking is so integral to our everyday lives that we forget how much we rely on it. In this as- signment, you will be implementing an algorithm that will track an object in a video. We will implement the Lucas-Kanade tracker, where two video sequences are provided: a car on a road, and a helicopter approaching a runway link. To initialize the tracker you need to define a tem- plate by drawing a bounding box around the ob- ject to be tracked in the first frame of the video. For each of the subsequent frames the tracker will update an affine transform that warps the current frame so that the template in the first frame is aligned with the warped current frame
