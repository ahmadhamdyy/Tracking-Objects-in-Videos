One incredibly important aspect of human and animal vision is the ability to follow objects and people in our view. Whether it is a tiger chasing its prey, or you trying to catch a basket- ball, tracking is so integral to our everyday lives that we forget how much we rely on it. In this as- signment, you will be implementing an algorithm that will track an object in a video. We will implement the Lucas-Kanade tracker, where two video sequences are provided: a car on a road, and a helicopter approaching a runway link. To initialize the tracker you need to define a tem- plate by drawing a bounding box around the ob- ject to be tracked in the first frame of the video. For each of the subsequent frames the tracker will update an affine transform that warps the current frame so that the template in the first frame is aligned with the warped current frame

Object tracking is a fundamental task in computer vi- sion with applications ranging from surveillance and au- tonomous navigation to augmented reality. The Lucas- Kanade algorithm stands as a cornerstone in the realm of optical flow-based object tracking. Developed by Bruce D. Lucas and Takeo Kanade in 1981, this algorithm has proven to be a robust and efficient method for tracking objects in consecutive frames of a video sequence.
At its core, the Lucas-Kanade algorithm addresses the challenge of estimating motion by assuming that the intensity patterns of the object remain constant between frames, under the local neighborhood assumption. Un- like global approaches, the algorithm focuses on tracking local image structures, making it particularly suitable for scenarios where objects exhibit smooth and gradual motion.
The key idea behind the Lucas-Kanade algorithm lies in the formulation of a set of linear equations for each pixel in the neighborhood of interest. By solving this system, the algorithm computes the optical flow vector, representing the apparent motion of the pixel between consecutive frames. This vector provides valuable infor- mation about the direction and magnitude of motion, forming the basis for object tracking.
One of the notable strengths of the Lucas-Kanade al- gorithm is its ability to handle spatial variations in mo- tion, making it well-suited for scenarios where objects exhibit different velocities across the image. Addition- ally, the algorithm is computationally efficient, enabling real-time implementation on various platforms.
We will dive into the key concepts of the Lucas- Kanade algorithm, exploring its underlying assumptions, mathematical formulation, and practical applications Us- ing Additive alignment in our algorithm. Understanding the fundamentals of this algorithm is crucial for those seeking to implement effective and reliable object track- ing solutions in computer vision systems.
